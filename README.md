# WPF_Prism_Skeleton
This repo is a good starting point for taking a look at a Prism MVVM view-based navigation layout in a WPF application.  I don't feel there are enough intermediate level tutorials on Prism out there, so I've created this repository.  Prism is a deep topic with a steep learning curve, so I'd like to keep this repo as light as possible by limiting the amount of code I'll include.  I did feel the need to jazz up the UI at least a little bit, so I brought in the Mahapps.Metro NuGet package.
